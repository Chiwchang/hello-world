          <p>Hi, I like traveling and learn new skilles. 
              I want to practice my code learning,so this wwebsite is 
              created out of practice. I also like making friends 
              around the world. Hope that we can know each other better.content-section
              If you wannt to know more about me, email me.
              <p>My target rigth now is to learn different language that I could take advantage with.</p>
                 In my college, I major in Foreign Language and Literature, which help me get deeper inside of literature world but at the same time teach me a hard lesson.
                  I'm not a diligiant student tbh and my Janpanese teacher is bad, whch  becomeS part of the reason I learn Japanes bad and had no intesest in it. Yet, when the time passed and I only had one year left to graduate. I find I HAD NOTHING TO COMPETE WITH OTHERS. That's face the reality, I didn't learn some professional skills and I only good at one language other than my native tongue.
                  I keep asking myself what am I good at and what I truly interested.
                  Then, that's what I'm doing right know, learn whatever I can and I also try to grb back my interests of language learning.
                  My target right know is to set my own website by writing the code by myself and read the Japanes and Spanish original novels.
                  Thank you, wish me good luck.
